# Thing Namer

Combine Adjectives and Nouns Together to Form a Random Name

## Installation

A binary release of this project is not available. To use this project you must compile it yourself.
We use [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) to build this project.

Run `mvn package` to create a Jar for this project.

## Usage

There are two tools in this project:

### Dictionary Parser

The dictionary parser generates a list of adjectives and nouns from a set of dictionary files and creates two files used
by the name generator: `adjectives.txt` and `nouns.txt`.
You must first download the
[GNU Collaborative International Dictionary of English](http://gcide.gnu.org.ua/).
Extract the contents of the downloaded archive to a directory on your computer.
We'll refer to this directory as `[dictionary folder]`.

To run the dictionary parser:

`java -cp thing-namer-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.queuedpixel.thingnamer.Parser [dictionary folder]/CIDE.*`

### Name Generator

The name generator takes a list of adjectives and nouns generated by the dictionary parser, and generates words in the
form of `adjective-noun`.
You must first run the dictionary parser.

To run the name generator:

`java -cp thing-namer-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.queuedpixel.thingnamer.Generator`
